### Insights
#### Store Performance Analysis
- **Top 10 Stores by Incremental Revenue (IR):** Identified the top 10 stores that generated the highest incremental revenue from the promotions.
- **Bottom 10 Stores by Incremental Sold Units (ISU):** Identified the bottom 10 stores in terms of incremental sold units during the promotional period.
- **City-wise Store Performance:** Analyzed the performance of stores by city to identify common characteristics among top-performing stores that could be leveraged across other stores.

#### Promotion Type Analysis
- **Top 2 Promotion Types by Incremental Revenue:** Determined the promotion types that resulted in the highest incremental revenue.
- **Bottom 2 Promotion Types by Incremental Sold Units:** Identified the promotion types with the least impact on incremental sold units.
- **Discount vs. BOGOF/Cashback Promotions:** Compared the performance of discount-based promotions with BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) and cashback promotions.
- **Best Balance Between ISU and Margins:** Identified promotions that strike the best balance between incremental sold units and maintaining healthy margins.

#### Product and Category Analysis
- **Significant Sales Lift by Category:** Determined which product categories saw the most significant lift in sales from the promotions.
- **Product-Specific Performance:** Identified specific products that responded exceptionally well or poorly to promotions.
- **Category and Promotion Type Correlation:** Analyzed the correlation between product category and promotion type effect.

### Recommendations
#### Focus on Effective Promotions
- Implement `â‚¹500 Cashback` for Combo1 products.
- Use `BOGOF` promotions for Grocery & Staples, Home Appliances, and Home Care.

#### Re-evaluate Ineffective Promotions
- Discontinue or modify `25% OFF`, `33% OFF`, and `50% OFF` promotions, especially for Grocery & Staples and Personal Care categories.

#### Leverage High-Performing Products
- Continue promoting top-performing items in Home Appliances (e.g., AtliQ Waterproof Immersion Rod) and Home Care (e.g., AtliQ Double Bedsheet Set).

#### Address Poorly Performing Products
- Adjust promotional strategies for low-performing products in Grocery & Staples and Personal Care.
- Explore non-discount-based promotions for Personal Care.
